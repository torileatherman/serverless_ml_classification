The purpose of this lab is to create a serverless ML classifiction system to classify the iris dataset. The culmination of this project resulted in two running apps found on huggingface:
1. Iris - an app that allows users to modify the features of an iris: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and upon submitting, the system would predict the genus of the iris and show the corresponding picture. https://huggingface.co/spaces/torileatherman/iris
2. Iris Monitfor - an app that shows the images of the prediction of today's flower and the image of today's actual flower. It also shows the recent prediction history, and the confusion matrix of historical prediction performance. https://huggingface.co/spaces/torileatherman/iris_monitor
